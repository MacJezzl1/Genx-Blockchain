   - Peer discovery and management
   - Network synchronization
   - Encrypted messaging between nodes

4. **Wallet System**
   - Key pair generation and management
   - Transaction signing and verification
   - Balance tracking and history
   - Web3 API compatibility

5. **Smart Contract Engine**
   - EVM-compatible execution environment
   - Gas calculation and limitation
   - Contract deployment and interaction
   - Solidity support

6. **Explorer UI**
   - Block explorer with detailed transaction view
   - Account/wallet information display
   - Network statistics and health monitoring
   - Dark mode interface with responsive design

### GENX Token Specifications

- **Symbol**: GENX
- **Total Supply**: 21,000,000 GENX
- **Decimal Places**: 18
- **Distribution**:
  - 60% - Genesis block allocation
  - 20% - Reserved for validator rewards
  - 10% - Development fund
  - 10% - Ecosystem growth

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Set up the basic project structure
2. Implement the block and transaction data structures
3. Create the genesis block configuration
4. Develop basic chain operations (add block, validate chain)
5. Implement state persistence

### Phase 2: Consensus and Networking

1. Implement the PoS consensus mechanism
2. Develop validator selection algorithm
3. Create P2P networking layer
4. Implement peer discovery and synchronization
5. Add encrypted messaging between nodes

### Phase 3: Wallet and Smart Contracts

1. Develop wallet functionality (key management, signing)
2. Implement transaction creation and validation
3. Create the EVM-compatible execution environment
4. Add support for smart contract deployment and execution
5. Implement gas calculation and limitations

### Phase 4: Explorer UI and Integration

1. Design and implement the explorer dashboard
2. Create block and transaction viewing interfaces
3. Develop wallet lookup and balance display
4. Implement network statistics monitoring
5. Integrate all components into a cohesive system

## Security Considerations

- **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Node identity verification system
- **Transaction Privacy**: Encrypted transaction payloads
- **Consensus Security**: Fault-tolerant design with slashing conditions
- **Smart Contract Safety**: Static analysis and formal verification tools
- **Key Management**: Secure wallet implementation with multiple recovery options

## Future Expansion

- **Sharding**: Horizontal scaling for improved transaction throughput
- **Layer 2 Solutions**: Off-chain scaling for microtransactions
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enhanced privacy features
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Interoperability with other blockchain networks
- **Governance System**: On-chain voting and protocol upgrades

## Development Requirements

- **Backend**: Rust for performance and memory safety
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Thorough API and protocol specifications
- **Deployment**: Containerized setup for easy node operation

## Getting Started (Development)
